# Delaunay-Triangulations

A Delaunay Triangulation, DT, is defined to be the triangulation where the circumcircle of each triangle is empty, that is it contains no vertices except its own. The circumcircle of a triangle is that circle that passes though its vertices: there are known formulae to get the circumcentre, O, and circumradius, R, from the vertex coordinates.

This project aims to generate the DT by using Bowyer-Watson algorithm. In this project, it has been divided into serval tasks to achieve the objectives.

This tasks include the OpenMP parallel programming, template design and omptimizations issues.
